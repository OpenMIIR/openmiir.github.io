title: OpenMIIR - public domain data & open source code for Music Imagery Information Retrieval
---

As an emerging sub-field of music information retrieval (MIR),
music imagery information retrieval (MIIR)
aims to retrieve information from brain activity recorded during music cognition - such as listening to or imagining music pieces.
This is a highly inter-disciplinary endeavor that requires expertise in MIR as well as cognitive neuroscience and psychology.
The OpenMIIR initiative strives to foster collaborations between these fields to advance the state of the art in MIIR.

## Datasets

### OpenMIIR 1

The first OpenMIIR dataset contains electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of music perception and imagination for 12 short music stimuli. 
It is intened to enable MIR researchers to easily test and adapt their existing approaches for music analysis like fingerprinting, beat tracking or tempo estimation on this new kind of data.

### OpenMIIR 2

A second dataset is in preparation.
